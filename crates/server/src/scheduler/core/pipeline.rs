//! 2026-09-25: The plain decode lane one step ahead of the host: the core's half of
//! the asynchronous router.
//!
//! With step `t` in flight, the decode lane launches `t+1` as a fed step (each
//! row's input is `t`'s device argmax, read on the device), then settles `t`:
//! awaits it, commits it, and validates `t+1` against the host state that
//! commit produced (`validate_next`). A row that has finished, or whose next
//! input or position no longer matches, is an over-run: its `t+1` result is
//! skipped at commit, and a `Rollback` releases the block `ReserveKv` added for
//! it. If a surviving row's mask changed, all of `t+1` is redone. The launch
//! bookkeeping (`tokens.push`, `seq_len += 1`) is applied to a fed row only
//! once it is validated.
//!
//! Whether a tick may run ahead is decided per tick by `ahead_allowed`; the
//! router's `max_depth` only caps it.
//!
//! Owner: scheduler.
//! Invariants:
//! - With `PipelineFaults::NONE`, a fed row's result is committed only when its
//!   input and position equal the host state after the previous commit.
