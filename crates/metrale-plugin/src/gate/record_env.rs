/// ★ `METRALE_PREFILL_CODISPATCH` itself is NOT here since G22 (2026-09-23).
/// It became the `--prefill-codispatch` flag, which a flag-driven serve never
/// writes back to the environment, so resolving it here disclosed the table
/// default `0` for serves running `--prefill-codispatch true` — every
/// concurrency-sweep record from 6c75c09da4 on. The flag is disclosed from the
/// resolved serve instead (`record_serve::PREFILL_CODISPATCH` in
/// `serve_resolved`), and a recipe that still declares the legacy variable has
/// it disclosed in `serve_env`. The two timing controls stay: the scheduler
/// still reads them from the environment only.
///
/// Kept beside the record rather than imported from the scheduler because
/// `metrale-plugin` does not depend on `spark-server`. That is a real duplication
/// and `perf_env_defaults_match_the_scheduler` pins it: if a default moves in
/// `scheduler::mod_helpers`, that test is what fails.
///
/// `METRALE_NO_W4A16_TC` is a PRESENCE kill switch (any non-empty value, `0`
/// included, turns the tensor-core small-M NVFP4 GEMV off), so its default is
/// the literal `unset`, the one value under which the tensor-core path ran.
/// `METRALE_W4A16_TC_WIDE` is the opposite polarity: an OPT-IN (any non-empty
/// value) that widens the tensor-core row edge from 8 to 16, so `unset` means
/// it did NOT run. `record_env_tests` pins both rules against
/// `layers/ops/gemv_tc.rs`. The W4A4 activation downcast is NOT here: it is
/// the `--w4a4-downcast` flag, disclosed in `serve_resolved`
/// (`record_serve::W4A4_DOWNCAST`).
///
/// `METRALE_NO_MTP_TC` is the same kind of PRESENCE kill switch as
/// `METRALE_NO_W4A16_TC`, for the MTP drafter's tensor-core BF16 GEMV: default
/// `unset` (the path ran), any set value disclosed verbatim.
/// `tc_mtp_switch_default_matches_the_lever` pins that rule against
/// `layers/ops/dense_gemv_tc.rs`.
///
/// `METRALE_NO_BORROW_STREAK_LIMIT` is the same kind of PRESENCE kill switch,
/// for the steady-state CUDA-graph borrow guard (a batch that keeps
/// borrowing a wider graph captures its own after 8 steps): default `unset`
/// (the guard ran). `borrow_streak_switch_default_matches_the_lever` pins it
/// against `model/trait_impl/borrow_streak.rs`.
