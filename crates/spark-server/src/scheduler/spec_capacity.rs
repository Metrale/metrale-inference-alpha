//! Tiered verify-pool DISPATCH clamp (2026-08-16).
//!
//! The MTP verify state pools size each slot's per-token H intermediates to
//! the deepest draft count the STATIC ladder can hand a sequence occupying
//! it (`ssm_reserve::verify_slot_h_intermediates` — slots 0..8 keep the full
//! `--num-drafts` under the default `4:3,8:3,16:1,32:1` ladder, slots 8..
//! are sized for one draft). Two dispatchers can exceed that static bound:
//!
//! * a TRANSIENT contiguity break (LIFO free-list claim after churn) can
//!   park a sequence on a high slot while `n_active` is small, where the
//!   ladder offers a deeper K than the slot holds;
//! * `adaptive_rung` may LIFT n in 9..=16 to 2 drafts on tool-shaped accept
//!   stats, above the static rung the sizing derives from.
//!
//! Spec dispatch is all-or-nothing, so the invariant is: the step's draft
//! count must respect the MINIMUM capacity across the slots of the
//! currently-active sequences — a sequence in a K=2-sized slot must never
//! receive K=4 drafts. Capacities come from the model's ACTUAL pool
//! geometry (`Model::mtp_slot_draft_capacity`), not a re-derivation, so
//! sizing and dispatch cannot disagree; `METRALE_MTP_POOL_FULL_WIDTH`
//! restores uniform full-K pools, which makes every capacity `num_drafts`
//! and this clamp vacuous. Consequence worth knowing: under the tiered
//! default the adaptive 16:2 lift is clamped back to K=2 whenever any
//! active sequence sits in a capacity-1 slot — i.e. at every n >= 9 under
//! contiguity — so re-enabling the lift requires the kill switch (or a
//! deeper explicit `METRALE_MTP_K_LADDER`, which widens the tier with it).
