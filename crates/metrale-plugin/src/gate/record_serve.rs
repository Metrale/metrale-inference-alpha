//! The serve knobs a gate record DISCLOSES about the server it measured.

//! `served_by` names a recipe in another repository at whatever version was
//! synced, and `serve_overrides` names only what the operator changed. Neither
//! says what the server actually ran with, and for one knob that gap has cost
//! real diagnosis: `mtp_gate: auto` is the standing explanation for
//! `agentic-webserver`'s intermittent 9/10, `metrale-recipes#16` pinned it to
//! `force` on 2026-08-28, and no record proves which regime any run was in —
//! a `BENCH.toml` `default = true` flip silently unpins a gate (#1159,
//! `docs/gate-queue-protocol.md`). A future failure whose record says `force`
//! is a pinned failure, and MTP nondeterminism is ruled out for free.
//!
//! The keys are named HERE, in the crate that owns the record, so the server
//! that resolves them and the tests that read them cannot drift apart.
